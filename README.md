### Description
  The **TodoList** application was implemented to display a knowledge of basic front-end web development. 
This application implements a mock back-end using live-server and json:server in order to store data upon refresh. The project
allowed me to freshen up on some basic concepts and learn some modern JavaScript principles such as IFFE Functions, Closure, Promises,
and custom HTTP request implementation.

### Functionality
  The Application allows users to submit new "todos" (or tasks) so that they may keep track of them. The core features are
adding a todo, editing existing todos, deleting a todo, and moving todos between the "Completed Tasks" list and the "Pending Tasks" list.
